# About Me:
Hi, I'm **Samuel Alarcon** (30y).  
- Backend developer focused on **C# / .NET**  
- Strong experience with **SQL Server** and system integration  
- **Information Security graduate** working close to physical & logical access control  
- Used to working with **access control, security and visitor management systems**  
- Always trying to simplify complex stuff

---

## 🚀 What I Do
- Design and maintain **access control / visitor management** platforms  
- Build **integrations between legacy systems, APIs and databases**  
- Implement **security controls** around identity, access and auditing  
- Write **automation scripts** (PowerShell / C#) to reduce manual work in ops  

---

## 💪 Strengths
- Comfortable with **C# / .NET + SQL Server** in real-world, production environments  
- Good at **debugging and reading logs** (Windows, services, NiFi, SQL, etc.)  
- Thinks in **automation first**: scripts, workers and services instead of manual clicks  
- Strong **security mindset** (least privilege, auditing, access control, backups)  
- Likes to **document and padronize**: endpoints, DB structures, scripts and flows  
- Not afraid to **merge infra + dev**: Windows Server, IIS, DB, Git, services, APIs  

---

## 🧩 Things I'm Improving
- Making architectures **cleaner from the start** (less “funciona agora, arrumo depois”)  
- Better **Git workflow** (branches, PRs, avoiding fighting with .vs and cache files)  
- Creating more **automated tests** instead of testar tudo só na mão  
- Getting more solid on **frontend / UI** when needed  
- Saying “não” pra overengineering quando um script simples resolve  

---

## 📚 Currently Learning
- **.NET 8** and modern background workers  
- **Clean architecture / DDD** for backend projects  
- Better **observability & logging** for distributed systems
